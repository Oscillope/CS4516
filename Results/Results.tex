\maketitle
In order to measure the effectiveness of our approach, we will collect performance metrics on our switching approach.
We will compare the results of these metrics to the performance of an unmodified software switch.
Due to the fact that neither switch will be implemented in hardware, our results may be slightly different than a hardware implementation.
We are looking to compare the behavior of the network at saturation both with and without redundant links.
We are going to look at the goodput of these situations with and without congestion control.
