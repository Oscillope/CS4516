\title{CS 4516 Project Proposal\\Group \#5: Bandwidth Trunking Using Layer 2 Devices}
\author{Jason Rosenman \and Louis Fogel \and Samuel Abradi}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
	Our project aims to address a need for more resilient Layer 2 by allowing multiple switch ports to be connected without the risk of forwarding loops or broadcast storms.
	In addition, we aim to allow switches to distribute bandwidth over multiple interfaces when connected together.
	This allows us to be competitive with systems such as Etherfuse, which prevents forwarding loops by disabling ports that it detects are linked.
\end{abstract}
\section{Need}
	In commercial applications, reliability and fool-proofing are important.
	If an entire network or a section of one can be taken down through a simple user error (or by a malicious user), there is a need for a system to address and resolve this.
