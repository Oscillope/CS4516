CS 4516 Term Project
====================

Layer 2 Routing
---------------

The code in this project is used for the simulation of network topologies under various conditions. Our goal is to
design and test a "smart" switch that would allow redundant links using bandwidth sharing and be auto-configuring.
The implementation of a regular "dumb" switch can be found in switch.py. This implementation is used as a control
and is also extentended by fancy_switch.py (to be renamed later), the implementation of our device for simulation
purposes.

The code for generation and measurement of network traffic will also eventually be included.
